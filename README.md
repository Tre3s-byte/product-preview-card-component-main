## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Overall, this is my first time using Sass, and I really enjoyed working with it. It made everything easier because it is well organized. The possibility to nest and avoid redundancy when creating variables and nesting selectors makes it clearer to understand where you are styling.

### Continued development

I hope I will be able to continue learning SASS using these tests, as well as React and Redux.
